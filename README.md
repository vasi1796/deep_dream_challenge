# deep_dream_challenge
## Description
Deep dream challenge completed from Siraj Raval's youtube video.</br>
Python script that uses Tensorflow and the Inception graph to observe the enhanched patterns learned by the network. Real time processing has to be done on a GPU.</br>
The approach from this repo is to build the video at the end or to use a keyboard interrupt at any time of the processing at observe the enhanced video.
## Dependencies
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Opencv
### TODO
* add option to choose layer to enhance
* add option for real time processing or build video at the end
* add option for fps of the video
